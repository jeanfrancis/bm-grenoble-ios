# BM Grenoble

iOS application for the Grenoble Public Library ([Bibliothèques municipales de Grenoble](https://www.bm-grenoble.fr)), displaying a list of your current loans. 

## How it works

The Grenoble Public Library doesn’t offer a public API to check your account status and loans. This app uses a hidden web view instead, programmatically signing in with the user credentials, then extracting the relevant data by parsing the HTML pages.

## Roadmap

- Multiple pages in results
- Local notification for reminders
- Store credentials in Keychain
- About dedicated screen
- Items cover image
- Multiple accounts support
- Renew loans
- Reservations
- Libraries list with map
